# Golden-Age-of-Video-Games
In this project, I'll analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. Aim of the project is to search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

Project includes functionalities such as data manipulation,cleaning and filtering.
